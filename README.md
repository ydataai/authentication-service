# Authentication Service

This is a simple project that makes the authentication service with the OIDC flow.

Basically, you need to have an OIDC Provider ([config parameters](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)) and configure the Authentication Service.

## OpenID Connect

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](http://openid.net/connect/) is an authentication layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. As OAuth 2.0 is fully supported by OpenID Connect, existing OAuth 2.0 implementations work with it out of the box.

Currently, it only supports OIDC's [Authorization Code Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#CodeFlow), similar to OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant.
